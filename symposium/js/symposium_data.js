                image: "assets/junhyong-kim.png",
                abstract: "In the last fifteen years, there has been an exponential increase in single cell biology and associated technology research. Single cell biology, from the start, has been a broad interdisciplinary field, integrating genomics, engineering, chemistry, and computation. But, understanding the functional basis of cells, especially in terms of their phenotypic functions, requires moving beyond single cell assays to multi-omic analysis of sub-cellular processes. In this talk, I first start with some personal reflections on the development of the field of single cell biology and key technologies. Then, I discuss work in my lab extending single cell biology to sub-cellular biology of single mitochondria sequencing in mammalian brain cells and to sub-cellular localization of mRNA in neurites as well as new deep learning methods for reconstructing single cell lineages.",

                abstract: "In alignment with the FDA Modernization Act 2.0, there is a growing focus on human microphysiological systems (MPS), such as organs-on-chips and organoids, to replace traditional animal models in drug discovery and safety testing. My lab leverages multi-scale biofabrication techniques, patient-derived organotypic cultures, and AI-empowered biosystems to develop advanced, high-throughput organ-on-chip platforms integrated with real-time functional phenotypic biosensors for predictive drug efficacy and toxicity screening. In this talk, I will introduce our recent work on a microphysiological model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an automated 96-well drug-induced cardiotoxicity assay, and spaceflight-induced muscle aging.",

                abstract: "Due to an inherent biological heterogeneity across individuals and within a disease, it is extremely challenging to identify robust biomarkers that can accurately represent molecular status of the body for disease diagnostics. To solve this intractable problem, we have developed microfluidic platforms and molecular tools that enable high throughput, multiplexed profiling of biomarkers (e.g. cells, extracellular vesicles; EV). To resolve cell and EV heterogeneity, we have developed an ultra-fast cycling method for single cell analysis and an ultra-high sensitive microfluidics that can achieve single particle detection sensitivity, enabling individual EV measurements.",

                abstract: "We feel the changing seasons every year, but the world we experience today is not quite the same as it was decades ago. After a cold winter, spring always returns, yet the spring we know has been gradually changing and may continue to do so in the future. How can we tell whether these changes are simply part of Earth’s natural variability, or signs of a fundamental change in the climate system? To answer this, scientists look beyond individual human lifetimes and study Earth’s climate history spanning thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. In this talk, I will explain how we know the climate has been changing, what the evidence tells us about human impacts, and how climate science informs our understanding of future climate change.",
